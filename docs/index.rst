**tile** is a command-line interface for stitching projections in horizontal direction. Stitching is done manually by selecting shifts for each tile. Selection of shifts is based on reconstructed slices and projections.

Once the stitching is completed the tomographic reconstruction can be done with `tomopy <https://tomopy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_/`tomopy cli <https://tomopycli.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ or `tomocupy <https://tomocupy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_
